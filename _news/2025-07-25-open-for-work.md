I'm currently open for work in the greater Seattle area. I'd been working in Mexico outside of the tech industry for a couple of years now, though I'm always looking to improve my coding skills. My recent projects include SPAs with InertiaJS, SSR pages with Express, and dabbling with Jekyll with this blog. As always, I try to implement best coding practices and implement containerization whenever applicable.
Feel free to browse my site for my [CV](../../cv), my socials, side projects, or perhaps a tutorial.
