In Approaches, Ernst Jünger describes his experiences with drugs over the course of his life, ranging from youthful drinking sprees, through experiments with hashish and morphine, to more powerful psychotropic substances like mescaline, peyote, and LSD. Combining elements of memoir and critical reflection on the history of mind-altering substances in society, Approaches attests to Jünger’s belief that drugs can facilitate a deeper spiritual journey into dimensions of human existence that have been eclipsed by the ambient noise of modern life.
