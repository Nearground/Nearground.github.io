"PHP Cookbook: Modern Code Solutions for Professional Developers" is a book by Eric Mann published by O'Reilly Media. This cookbook-style resource provides practical, self-contained code recipes to help PHP developers solve common programming problems and implement established patterns in their daily work.

This book is more suited for beginners in software development in general. Having just read Laravel Up and Running and being familiarized with algorithms in general, I skipped over most of it and was able to retain some good tricks on how to make writing more efficient or optimized.
