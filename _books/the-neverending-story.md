It begins when you become part of it, too...

Only once in a great while do stories come along that fulfill our deepest longing--our wish to experience true enchantment. THE NEVERENDING STORY is such a fantasy: the magical tale of a lonely, solitary boy who steps through the pages of a book into a special kingdom. There, in an imaginary land, on a special and dangerous quest, Bastian learns the true measure of his own courage. And learns that even he has the capacity to love.
