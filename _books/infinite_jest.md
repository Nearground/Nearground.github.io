What can I say about this masterpiece? It's got tennis, addiction, ghosts, discussions on the meaning of life, the horrors of rampant capitalism, the banality of seeking comfort, ghosts, and the importance of communication. One day I will set about to work on an earnest review of this gem, but for now, I'll just say this book keeps haunting me.
