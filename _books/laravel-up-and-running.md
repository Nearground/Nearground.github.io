What sets Laravel apart from other PHP web frameworks? Speed and simplicity, for starters. This rapid application development framework and its ecosystem of tools let you quickly build new sites and applications with clean, readable code. Fully updated to include Laravel 10, the third edition of this practical guide provides the definitive introduction to one of today's most popular web frameworks.

This book served as my introduction to not just Laravel, but PHP, InertiaJS, and Vue. The explanations of all the concepts involved in making a full stack application with Laravel are all very thorough, and it contains very few errata. I had no trouble getting into Laravel, and as a result, I've been able to create my own Laravel and Vue app template.
