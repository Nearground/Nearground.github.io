Through the blog 'Mark & Angel Hack Life' and now through this book, the Chernoffs present a blend of positive psychology and strategies for coping with change, loss, and everything else life throws your way. The goal is not to help you get rid of all your negative thoughts, feelings, and life situations. That is impossible. The goal is to change your response to them via actionable steps for bouncing back from tough times and getting back on the road to happiness and success. Learn how to harness the power of daily rituals and self-care to shift your perspective (and actions) in order to become your happiest and most effective self.
