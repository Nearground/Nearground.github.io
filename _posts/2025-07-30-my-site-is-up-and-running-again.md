I've recently been obsessing over game design, especially procedural
generation algorithms. One that caught my eye early on is called Wave Function
Collapse. It's a little bit of a sensationalist name, but it really is
inspired after quantum mechanics. I'm working through a few tutorials on how
to implement this on javascript so I can post it on the site, then I'll make
the leap to C# with Unity in order to use it for level generation. Lately,
BorisTheBrave and InformationPhilosopher have been a giant source of inspiration.
